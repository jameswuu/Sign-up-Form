# Sign-up-Form

### Description
The purpose of this project is to apply newly learned CSS techniques and the form tag. This exercise involves developing a form for users to collect information such as name, email, etc. While gathering their data, it is also important to validate their input and remind them if their information is incorrectly entered. In addition to validating through patterns and types of data, CSS styling validation will also be implemented to help users easily identify their errors.

### Expectations
After completing the project, I will have a better understanding of how to set up formal and proper forms to collect data on the client's end, as well as how to perform validation.
